    <h2>A different take on meatballs</h2>
    <p>
        So, here in Mexico we have a vary specific way of making meatballs. We stuff them with rice, and serve them in a light tomato broth. 
        And don't get me wrong, they're great! This meatballs recipe, however, is, <em>in my opinion,</em> much more flavorful, but still manages to capture the charm of the original recipe.
    </p>
    <p>Here's how we make them.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion.</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes.</li>

        <li>1 egg.</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the onion in a pan with oil.</li>
        <li>Add the onion to the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Add the spices to the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Make little balls with the meat.</li>
        <li>Fry the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Once fried, add tomatoes, salt, tomato puree and garlic.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Add shredded cheese.</li>
